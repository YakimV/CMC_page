          <h2>Warning and Disclaimer</h2>
          <p><strong>Warning:</strong><br>
              The application described in this guide allows advanced customization of mouse functions, which may involve modifying system drivers and using third-party software. These actions could potentially cause unexpected behavior, compatibility issues, or system instability. Proceed with caution and ensure that you fully understand the steps involved before making any changes.

            <h2>About the Application</h2>
            <p>Customize the second mouse as an additional tool!</p>
            <p>The program allows you to use a second mouse to launch shortcuts, files, or scripts. Assign any actions to its buttons and automate routine tasks in your work.  The program has a simple interface and is aimed primarily at simplifying work, it may not work in games!</p>
            <p>The program is actively developing, I recommend checking sources for the release of a new version of CMC</p>

        <section class="step">
          <h2>2. Installing a Special Driver for the Mouse</h2>
          <p>Download the <strong>LibUSB</strong> driver. It is recommended to use the <strong>Zadig</strong> utility for installation.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open Zadig and follow these steps:</li>
            <li>Go to the <em>Options</em> menu → select <em>List All Devices</em>.</li>
            <li>Find your mouse in the list.<br>
              <small>Tip: Disconnect and reconnect the mouse to identify it in the list.</small>
            </li>
            <li>Some mice may have multiple interfaces (e.g., for different buttons or functions). Typically, <strong>interface 0</strong> corresponds to the main buttons, so select it.</li>
            <li>In the driver field, choose <strong>LibusbK</strong> or <strong>Libusb</strong> (both will work).</li>
            <li>Click the <strong>Install Driver</strong> button.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
    
        <section class="step">
          <h2>3. Obtaining Vendor ID and Product ID</h2>
          <p>After installing the driver, copy two values in USB ID:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vendor ID</strong> (left parameter).</li>
            <li><strong>Product ID</strong> (right parameter).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Insert these values into the corresponding fields in the application. To unlock these fields, use the appropriate button in the application's interface.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section class="step">
          <h2>4. Configuring Functions for Mouse Buttons</h2>
          <p>After setting up the driver, you can assign functions to the mouse buttons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Select ready-made functions from the dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>To create custom shortcuts:
              <ul>
                <li>Write the shortcut in the field in the format: <code>key:ctrl+c</code></li>
                <li>(Almost all keys are supported. You can see a list of them <a class = "link" href="tips.html" target="_blank">Here</a>)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To launch files or scripts:
              <ul>
                <li>Specify the file path in the corresponding field.</li>
                <li>You can also use the button to select a file.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
    
        <section class="step">
          <h2>5. ALSO...</h2>
          <p>Audio files are played through your default audio player. Files in the <strong>.wav</strong> format are played in the background without opening the player.</p>
          <p>Testing took place on 8-bit mice and windows 11</p>
          <p class="guide">To return the mouse driver to the standard version, just search for something like libusb in the device manager and uninstall the device, if possible, be sure to check the “try to uninstall the driver” box, and then reconnect the mouse.</p>
